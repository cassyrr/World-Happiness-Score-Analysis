# World Happiness Score Analysis

## Objective

The goal of this project is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the World Happiness Report dataset, exploring the factors that contribute to the happiness index in various countries. The dataset includes key indicators such as GDP (representing the economic aspect), Life Expectancy (reflecting the health dimension), and degrees of freedom. By examining these factors, we aim to gain insights into how the local economy, health conditions, and political factors collectively influence people's well-being.

- **Correlation Analysis:** Investigate the correlations between the happiness index and individual indicators, such as GDP, Life Expectancy, and degrees of freedom.
- **Regional Comparisons:** Compare happiness scores and contributing factors among regions to uncover patterns and disparities.

## Methodology

The project leverages the following main tools and technologies:

- **Platform:** Colab Jupyter Notebook
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
